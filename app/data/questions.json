      "question": "What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?",
      "answer": "<div>
        <p>Although <code>typeof bar === "object"</code> <em>is</em> a reliable way of checking if <code>bar</code> is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that <code>null</code> is <em>also</em> considered an object!</p>
        <p>Therefore, the following code will, to the surprise of most developers, log <code>true</code> (not <code>false</code>) to the console:</p>
        <pre><code>var bar = null;
        console.log(typeof bar === "object");  // logs true!
        </code></pre>
        <p>As long as one is aware of this, the problem can easily be avoided by also checking if <code>bar</code> is <code>null</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log((bar !== null) &amp;&amp; (typeof bar === "object"));  // logs false
        </code></pre>
        <p>To be entirely thorough in our answer, there are two other things worth noting:</p>
        <p>First, the above solution will return <code>false</code> if <code>bar</code> is a function.  In most cases, this is the desired behavior, but in situations where you want to also return <code>true</code> for functions, you could amend the above solution to be:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log((bar !== null) &amp;&amp; ((typeof bar === "object") || (typeof bar === "function")));
        </code></pre>
        <p>Second, the above solution will return <code>true</code> if <code>bar</code> is an array (e.g., if <code>var bar = [];</code>).  In most cases, this is the desired behavior, since arrays are indeed objects, but in situations where you want to also <code>false</code> for arrays, you could amend the above solution to be:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log((bar !== null) &amp;&amp; (typeof bar === "object") &amp;&amp; (toString.call(bar) !== "[object Array]"));
        </code></pre>
        <p>Or, if youâ€™re using jQuery:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log((bar !== null) &amp;&amp; (typeof bar === "object") &amp;&amp; (! $.isArray(bar)));
        </code></pre>
        </div>"
